Step 1: Define the tools - weather data api from open weather map and search internet from duck duck go. 
Get your openweathermap api key from the [official website](https://home.openweathermap.org/).

Step 2: Implement the search_internet and get_weather_info functions.

Step 3: Initialize the OpenAI client.

Step 4: Define the main conversation function run_conversation.

Step 5: Run the conversation with our tools.

I am using SingleStore notebooks (just like Jupyter Notebooks but with added features) to run the code and understand how function calling works.
